## 🔬 Assessment Logic

The application follows a clinical decision tree for dehydration assessment:

1. **General Appearance Assessment**
   - Normal appearance → Eye examination
   - Irritable/lethargic → Skin pinch test

2. **Follow-up Assessments**
   - **Eyes**: Normal/slightly sunken vs. very sunken
   - **Skin**: Normal pinch vs. slow pinch

3. **Diagnosis Results**
   - **No dehydration**: Normal appearance + normal/slightly sunken eyes
   - **Some dehydration**: Irritable/lethargic + normal skin pinch
   - **Severe dehydration**: Normal appearance + very sunken eyes OR irritable/lethargic + slow skin pinch
